### Why Nyasa?
This repo was named after a great African lake called <b>[Lake Nyasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Malawi)</b>. It is located in [Malawi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malawi) ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¼ (and known to the Malawians as <b>Lake Malawi</b>), in [Mozambique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique) ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¿ (and known to the Mozambicans as <b>Lago Niassa</b>) and [Tanzania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzania) ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¿(as Lake Nyasa).

There are so many interesting things about Lake Nyasa such as, 
- It is also the fourth largest fresh water lake in the world by volume, the ninth largest lake in the world by area â€” and the third largest(after Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika) and second deepest lake in Africa! 
- Lake Nyasa's water layers do not mix and it has 14 rivers pouring their waters into the lake, with only one river flowing out to the sea, River Shire.
- Lake Nyasa is biologically the most diverse lake, containing approximately 30% of worldâ€™s cichlid species (colorful fish which are easily seen in the lakeâ€™s clear water).
